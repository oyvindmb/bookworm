# bookworm
I  created a bookshelf made of a 14x9 grid of squares, since changed to 14x8 with 16 neopixels in each square. In each square are four neopixels hooked up to two Fadecandy controllers and a Raspberry Pi. This project contains some javascript games created for this bookshelf grid.

The first one; "Bookworm", I used to propose to my then girlfriend, now wife. Therefore the win screen shows a picture of an engagement ring. The second one is a Tetris clone. Both may have some quirks and bugs, since this was largely created as a proof of concept. Day to day we use the rainbow.js to show a gradualy changing set of colors, which adds a bit of ambiance to our living room.  

This project requires the Fadecandy Server to be set up and opc.js from https://github.com/scanlime/fadecandy

The configuration file for fadecandy server is bookshelf.json

You can read more about the project on my wifes blog here:
